# Zoopla House Prices
In this project, I use the packages BeautifulSoup and requests to collect data on some of the houses posted on zoopla.com. Among other things, I collect the description of the house, its location, price, number of bathrooms, bedrooms and and living rooms. Finally, I render this data in the form of a dataframe, pending further analysis.
